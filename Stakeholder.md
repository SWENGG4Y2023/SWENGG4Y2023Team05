# **Blinkit Food App Stakeholders**

Here is a list of **Internal, External and Hidden Stakeholders and project build team** for Netflix.

## **Internal Stakeholders**

Internal stakeholders are individuals or groups that have a direct relationship with a business or organization and have an interest in its success. They are often called "insiders" because they work for and are closer to the company  than external stakeholders.

Internal stakeholders can include:

1)Employees: Employees are the most common  internal stakeholder group and  are critical to the company's success. Their performance can have a great impact on the company's success, as they are directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the company.Managers and Directors: Managers and directors are responsible for overseeing the company's operations  and  have  significant influence over the company's management and decision-making.  
2)Shareholders: Shareholders are individuals or groups who own part of a  company's stock. They are interested in the  financial development and results of the company, and they can have a say in important decisions concerning the company.  Board of Directors: The Board of Directors is a group of people elected by the shareholders to oversee the  management of the company and ensure that it operates in the best interests of the shareholders. 
3)Partners: Partners are companies or individuals who work with the company to provide goods or services and  have a vested interest in the success of the company. 

Internal stakeholders are closely related to the company and their interests are closely related to the success of the company. They have the power to influence the company's direction and decision-making, and their feedback is essential to developing effective strategies and policies.

## **External Stakeholders**

They do not belong to the company, but  interact with it in various ways and are interested in its activities and results.
xternal stakeholders can include:

1)Customers: Customers are individuals or groups who purchase goods or services from a business. They have a significant impact on the company's financial performance and reputation, and their satisfaction is essential to the company's success. 
2)Suppliers: Suppliers are individuals or companies that provide goods or services to a company. Their ability to deliver quality goods or services on time can have a significant impact on a company's operations. 
3)Government: Government through its regulatory policies and laws has a significant impact on business operations. This can affect the company's ability to operate,  financial performance and  reputation.  
4)Community: The community surrounding a business can be an important external stakeholder. This can affect the company's reputation and affect its ability to attract customers, employees and investors.  
5)Competitors: Competitors are other companies operating in the same industry as the company. Their actions and decisions can affect the company's market share, pricing strategy and overall competitiveness.  Media: The media can have a significant impact on a company's image through their reports and comments. This can affect customer perception and affect a company's ability to attract and retain customers. 
6)From the point of view of the company's success, external interest groups are important, whose interests must be taken into account during strategic decisions. Understanding their needs and expectations is critical to developing effective strategies and policies that benefit both the company and its external stakeholders.

## **Hidden stakeholders**
Hidden stakeholders are individuals or groups that may not be immediately obvious, but can still have a significant impact on the success of Blinkit's food program. These stakeholders may have an indirect relationship with the company and may not be easily identified, but their actions and decisions may still affect the operation and results of the application. Here are some examples of hidden stakeholders in the Blinkit meal program:

1)Local councils and government agencies are responsible for  food delivery services. These organizations may affect the application's ability to function in certain locations, and their regulatory practices may affect the operation of the application. 
2)Internet service providers (ISPs) and mobile  operators. The Blinkit Food App relies on these service providers for a reliable and fast connection, and any interruption or disruption may affect the performance of the app. 
3)Server center providers and cloud service providers. The Blinkit Food App is likely to store user data and run on  cloud infrastructure, and  disruptions or problems with these providers may affect the  performance and security of the app. 
4)Cyber security experts and consultants. These individuals can help identify and prevent cyber threats and protect user data from data breaches or unauthorized access, which can significantly affect the app's reputation and user trust.  
5)Delivery partners and logistics providers. These partners are responsible for the timely delivery of orders, and any problems or delays can affect customer satisfaction and the reputation of the app. Understanding hidden stakeholders and their potential impact is important for Blinkit's food application to identify potential risks and growth opportunities. Taking into account the needs and expectations of all stakeholders, including hidden ones, the application can develop effective strategies and practices to ensure its long-term success.
